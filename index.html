    <h2> Creative Statement</h2>
     <img src="images/IMG_0139.jpg" width="350px" height="350px">
    <p>My name is Wally Liang. My work revolves around photography and photography based tools to invoke compelling emotions of familiarity and nostalgia, 
      but also a sense of identity and purpose within our world.</p>
    <p>I am from the Lower East Side of Manhattan, growing up around Chinatown and coming from an immigrant family </p>
