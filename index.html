    <h1>Wally Liang's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2> Creative Statement</h2>
     <img src="images/IMG_0139.jpg" width="400px" >
    <p>My name is Wally Liang, I'm from the Lower East Side of Manhattan. My work revolves around photography and photography based tools to invoke compelling ideas of beauty, familarity, and peacefulness, whilst also being an autobiography.</p>
    <p>My main influences come from the entire planet, from hustling cities, to quiet farms, to the dangerous peaks of mountains. The world around me inspires to create, more than just one specific place like New York City, or Yellowstone National Park, or etc. The views are what inspire me to create and achieve those ideas as we often forget the world around us and the beatuy within each of those areas. Capturing moments of what I view goes to the autobiography, taking pictures of the small moments of my life as well.</p>
