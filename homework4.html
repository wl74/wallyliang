  <h1>Photomontage</h1>

  <img src="images/2184R02-R01-017-1.jpg" width="400px"> 

  <p>With this image in particular, I wanted to capture the focus of a personal but also a social issue that can be applicable to many people on a personal issue as well. As for me personally, I constantly feel like time is moving way too fast. That I want to be stuck in a memory. The original photo was with me and my friends, the birds were another of my image (used in the second image as well), but some images that weren't mine, was the overlay of sand, the ice that masked the people in the photo, and the eye. Each of them symbolizing something related with nostaglia or memory. Sand as in reference to time and how limited it is, the Eye looking back at the memories with the ice representing how we're stuck in time. With the birds being freedom, something that could be achieved to replicate memories like those everyday if reality never existed. Each image was to display a personal and selfish thing that we all have, to live in the past and feel dragged into it. </p> <br />
