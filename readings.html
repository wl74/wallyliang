<h1>Homework #1: Web Basics</h1>
<p>Although coding doesn’t come off as media or media related, it does build a foundation for media to get out on the internet. Most websites we have today are related to media, whether it be YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, etc. Requires and relies on some aspect of code or programming.  Beyond writing code, it makes it much easier for news stations, newspapers, content creators, and many more media creators / artists to convey their content, their message, and their artistic ideas to the world. Coding gives us as artists, media producers, or consumers a chance to fully understand and utilize platforms, code written by others a chance to make something. Also reading the article and watching the video for a more in-depth explanation of the code language, HTML. I’ve taken to understanding fundamental ideas and terminology that is very helpful when using it to create a website. That will mainly be showcasing my portfolio whilst I’m at Hunter. I had signed up for GitHub to make my site, but also to practice coding so certain prompts wouldn’t become an issue, also messing around with things like the tables and other things as well. I’ve also signed up for Code Academy, to also help me visual as the article demonstrates certain key terminology but also playing with other terms that wasn’t assigned as well. Learning those to make my website look neater or come off in a certain way.</p>

<h1>Homework #2: Cropping and Resizing Images & Tonal Range & "In Plato's Cave" Response</h1>
<p>Before reading the initial text itself, I thought about what photographs, photography, and image making meant to me.  What capturing images meant to me is like what I had wrote in my first draft of my creative statement. That I simply want to capture what the world has to offer, that my works are centralized about photographing the world. Whether it be big or small, something that Susan had pointed out within the first few pages. With the line “To collect photographs is to collect the world.”, this line explains what photographs and photographing means. The simplest way to put it is to cultivate/collect fragments of the world. Even using the story mentioned within that same paragraph, Les Carabiniers by Godard. Instead of sending them monetary gifts to their wives, they instead send pictures of places they’ve been to. That’s the power of photography, to experience something personal to you but also being able to share your experiences, in your own view, is what makes photography so appealing. Which is why it means so much to mean. But with this reading it has branched from not only that idea, but many other ideas. The idea of photography is peculiar in a way that I haven’t thought of the idea of aggressiveness, is that the photographer capturing a specific moment is beautiful but also annoying in a way. Simply turning people into a subject, almost like owning them in a sense. Which has changed my understanding of what I need to be conscience of when taking pictures. Not to make people subjects despite me being a candid photographer when people just act natural. With our world now, with leaders wanting to go for other’s necks, the world is slowly collapsing from human greed, the inability to make a connection anymore due to the world increasingly going digital. Every action that you do or take feels like you’re harming the world more than you’re fixing the world. For my photography or image making, I believe addressing the situation bit by bit, a series of photos. From wildlife, to what their environment looks like, with a combination of illustrations, using colors to represent how we can be hopeful and lead to change rather than suffering with our consequences. The digital world has focused on the ongoing use of phones with illustrations of hypnotic ideas. Political leaders having their faces and governments crossed out as the patterns are pushed more towards the idea of themselves, their own greed and lust for power or domination of themselves. There’s a whole lot more issues that exist in this world, but those are the notions or issues that I currently see a lot today. Being addicted to technology feeling like we need to rely on it to give us answers to basic questions,  world leaders seemingly ready to push that big red button that has the word “nuke” on it, because someone said their name wrong, and even polluting more into or world today, throwing trash just because we feel like. </p>
<p>Already having previous knowledge and experience with photography, it was like a walk in the park. With my previous experiences, I had always focused more on composition than the technical aspects of photography. Already inputting the knowledge for photography, I chose places and spots that are kind of awkward but also not at the same time. For me personally, I like these cool corner spots that you peek over and guide me in a way. Or following a framing way, I usually use lots with the foreground as it pops out and catches the attention of the viewer. But besides photography itself, I wanted to focus more on photoshop, as this is my first time using it. I typically prefer lightroom over photoshop when it comes to editing photos since I primarily focus on the colors of the images. But messing around with photoshop was fun, as it gave me a somewhat small look, to being a graphic artist in a way, even though we haven’t really touched on that. Overall, with the experiences from photography, it has allowed me to feel a lot more comfortable with what I want to capture, and who I strive to be in the future. Understanding the way light works will come in handy if I work in other aspects of media, since light is primarily the key thing for many artists, whether that be filmmaking, photographers, animators. It’s allowed me to understand light better. </p>

<h1>Homework #3: Depth of Field</h1>
<p>The Biggest issue for me, in terms of this homework assignment was honestly getting used to the user interface of photoshop. I think my favorite part of this assignment was the use of the lasso tool, which is funny. Simply because there are so many tools to choose from, whether you want to make it a straight line or a curvy line. I think trying to nail those basics will come with time and lots of practice. But it’s fun to use and mess around with.  I think dedicating more time to using photoshop opens new worlds and ideas for graphic design. It makes me think a lot of how I should use this tool to convey the message I want to convey. Visually speaking rather than writing, it allows me to incorporate my ideas of what I believe is the best suited for my message and how it can impact the viewer. As photos with composition and being in focus matters. The other part of the assignment was using camera raw. This to me felt second nature, as I’ve used Lightroom in the past, so understanding how to use the color wheels and the curve tool in camera raw came fairly simple and quickly. This also adds on to what I was saying about the depth of field, as colors also represent things thematically. Often you see like blue used to be represented as sadness, yellow as happiness, red as anger, and so on. Understanding the complexity of colors also adds a lot to how I as a media maker will get my message out and across. </p>

<h1>Homework #4: Photomontage & "With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster" Response</h1>
<p>The term AI slop is a term we’ll hear from today to future generations that involve a lot with AI. Now reading this article, does bring up the more ethical aspects. Things such as your family members with these group chats falling for these videos. Making it easier to scam or trick the consumer into thinking that it’s real, when in reality, it never was. That’s what I wanted to focus on with AI, the ethical parts of the job used for it. At some point AI is going to be hyper realistic. A couple of years ago, it was looking like a mess, especially with Will Smith eating spaghetti but with the recent years of development, it’s harder to see if it’s actually real or not. It also brings this question into play, is AI art considered art? I mean by the definition of art, it’s about human expression and using human skills to portray that expression. So, it becomes more about what’s the line with AI. I can understand AI as it’s helping you as a tool but should not be treated as a creator.  The lines from the article, “low quality content and minimal human input” shows how AI really works and really is. It does what many people originally did. Take time and effort to apply the skills necessary, struggle with the ideas that they originally had, stop learning and thinking for themselves. Which hurts the media fields, from art, animation, film, music, dance. It’s taking human culture and ruining it, as it’s something that we can all connect with each other.  But the worst part about AI slop is that it costs so little to generate millions of “works”. It can ruin lots of industries. Especially the creative field, since big companies are willing to save every single penny for themselves, they won’t hire the people who can make the right advertisements, they won’t hire animators, they won’t hire the right musicians, they won’t even hire the people who have honed their skills to dance. For them to save a couple of bucks.  What’s even more deplorable about AI slop is the capability of deep fakes, to fake someone saying or acting in a certain way in a video or audio file. Especially when it comes to celebrities or these influencers where they get sexualized into doing something that they never or will never do. The kind of content AI can propose is funny at times, but most of the time, AI is seen as harmful due to the user and not the AI. But that is also wrong, as AI companies used already existing content and trained their AIs to do the things imported to. This also refers to another class where it asked us if AI music is ethical, as the big label records like Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group sued those companies for copyright infringement on the basis that they used the songs to train the music AI.  So, it comes down to that, that AI although can be useful as a tool, it should not and never be used as a creator.  </p>
<p>Photomontages are really amazing and interesting. The idea that it’s a collage but a digital version is amazing. As learning photoshop pushes those ideas out further. In the pictures that are linked down below are talking about 2 ideas that I’ve thought of.  With the whole country being on fire, based on someone’s opinions and ideas. It has got them killed or shunned out of their position. Which really leads back to the whole idea of the first amendment. The second one talks more personally about my life but is very relatable to many others. With time limited, and many times on end, I constantly look back at good times or memories to hold myself together. To “feel” that way that I once did. Both were possible due to learning photoshop. Learning the intricate ways of how layers work and using a multitude of tools to make me envision and speak out on those social issues, is amazing.  During this week, I learned a lot about how photomontages are extremely important and impactful to society. Letting the creator tell and push their ideas for all of the public to see is motivating. But regardless learning about the idea of photomontages allows me as a photographer even outside of class to create and hone my own skills, ideas, to make them better and push it out further. I would like to go into more detail about the choices of images as well, but it is much easier to read them on the page linked below. </p>
