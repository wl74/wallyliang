<p>Image shown on left is the original, Image shown on the right is the cropped verison. </p>

<p>For the second image, I used the rule of thirds composition with the chair being in the bottom right corner. The way I edited the picture was something I already had in mind, to make it black and white and appear in such a way to give it that old feeling. Especially with what the environment looked like and what it was surrounded by, it definitely fitted that feeling.</p>
