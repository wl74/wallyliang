  <p>You gave him a high percent tip!?</p>
  <p>Well, lets find out how what happens...</p>
  <p>Your delivery driver knocks at your door after 5 minutes within ordering, you open the door, and you get the bag alongside some goodies. </p>
  <p>He asks if you'd like anything else along within the food that was delivered to you.</p>
  <p>You open the bag to find that...</p>
  <p>He got every sauce needed, even though it's Eggs and Toast, regardless he asks how he could repay with this generous tip.</p>
  <p>You said nothing more was needed, and happily ate the Eggs and Toast.</p>

  <h2>You Win!</h2>
  <p>You win because you tipped high enough that he went above and beyond to satisfy your need, and your stomach too.</p>
    
  <p>You can try a different road path if you'd like!</p>
