  <h1>Illustrated Environment</h1>
  <img src="images/IMG_0920.jpg" width="400px" >
  <p>This is the image used for the reference for the illustrated environment, this was a photo of mine that I had taken and had edited in Lightroom to help dictate which colors were used. Despite the image being in a portrait aspect ratio, I was able to work around itnas it give me more notice of small details for this environment.</p>

  <img src="images/illustrated environment.jpg" width="400px" >
  <p>This is the image that I reproduced within Adobe Illustrator, though it lacks a lot of the environment, it does relate a lot to my personal ideas and work of isolation and peace. The colors used were Yellow, Blue, and Orange. Orange was that surpursing color as you don't really see that color within this image but it's actually apart of the gray/tan part of the building.</p>
