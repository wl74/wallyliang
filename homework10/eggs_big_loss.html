  <p>As you're cooking the eggs, you notice the split vegetable oil, you try and hurry up to clean the oil to prevent a fire because of the high heat.</p>
  <p>Whilst you're cleaning, you smell a burning sensation almost. You dart your head around the kitchen to see what it is, and to your horror, it's the toaster.</p>
  <p>You quickly run to it, in an attempt to unplug it, but you're too late. You see a fire from the toaster and dare not to touch it, you turn around to look at the counters. And it too, has started a fire of sorts.</p>
  <p>You sprint out of your house, before it gets engulfed in flames.</p>
  <p>Not only are you still starving, but you now no longer have a home.</p>
