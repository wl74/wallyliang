  <h1>It's nice and cozy at home!</h1>

  <p>You decided to stay home and make your meal.</p>
  <p>You grab the pan for the eggs and you grab the toaster to make the toast.</p>
  <p>But now you have to figure out what's needed to be cooked.</p> 
  <p>You notice for your outlets that there's only two of them available, one burnt and one safe.</p>
  <p>You also think to yourself about the temperature used to cook eggs, high heat or low heat.</p>

  <h2>Make your choice...</h2>
