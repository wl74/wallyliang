  <h1>YOU DID WHAT!?</h1>
    
  <p>A little birdie told me that you didn't tip...</p>
  <p>Well, lets find out...</p>
  <p>Your delivery driver knocks at your door, you open the door, and you got a bag thrown at you. </p>
  <p>He slams the door on you, which is odd, but not to be expected.</p>
  <p>You open the bag to find that...</p>
  <p>He ate your meal on the way, to your address...</p>
  <p>He also left a sticky note saying some not so kind things as well.</p>

  <h2>You Lose!</h2>
  <p>You lose since you don't have anything to eat.</p>
  <p>Maybe Tip your Delivery Driver next time?</p>
