  <h1>WOO HOO, you're an amazing Chef!</h1>

  <p>You had no worries about making the toast since you had pluuged the cord to the safe outlet.</p>
  <p>So you had dedicated most of your time to the eggs. But whilst making them, you realized that vegetable oil was all over the counters.</p>
  <p>Thankfully you had it on a low heat, giving you lots of time to clean up whilst your egg was cooking itself.</p>
  <p>After the clean up, you had grabbed a plate for both the eggs and toast, and just relaxed right after, leaving your stomach full and happy.</p>

  <h2>You Win!</h2>

  <p>You've Won! But you can try a different road path if you'd like!</p>
